## About Origami CMS

Origami CMS is a web Laravel Content MAnagement framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Origami CMS attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web cms projects.
